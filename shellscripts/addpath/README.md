## How to Use `addpath.sh`

### Prerequisites
- A Unix-like system (Linux, macOS, WSL)
- Bash shell (default on most systems)

### Installation
1. **Create a `bin` directory** (if you don't have one):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/bin
   ```

2. **Save the script** to `~/bin/addpath.sh`:
   ```bash
   nano ~/bin/addpath.sh
   ```
   Paste the script content and save (`Ctrl+X` → `Y` → `Enter`).

3. **Make it executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/bin/addpath.sh
   ```

4. **(Optional) Add `~/bin` to your PATH** to run it from anywhere and alias 'ap' to run addpath.sh with the command ap:
   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'alias ap="~/bin/addpath.sh"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

### Usage
1. Navigate to the directory you want to add to PATH:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/directory
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   addpath.sh
   ```

3. **Reload your shell** to apply changes:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

### Example
```bash
cd ~/projects/my_scripts  # Contains important scripts
addpath.sh               # Add this directory to PATH
source ~/.bashrc         # Refresh
my_script               # Now runs from anywhere!
```

### ⚠️ Security Note
Adding directories to PATH has security implications. Only add trusted directories!


### Key Features
✅ **Idempotent** - Won't add duplicates  
✅ **Portable** - Works from any directory  
✅ **Explicit** - Requires manual PATH reload
