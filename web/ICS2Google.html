        This tool allows you to upload an ICS (iCalendar) file from your computer and generate a link to add the event to your Google Calendar.
        Please ensure you are logged into your Gmail account on this browser to add the event successfully.
    </p>

    <p>
        An ICS file, also known as an iCalendar file, is a universal file format used by various calendar and email applications to store scheduling information.
        Many websites and services provide appointment details in ICS format because it is supported across multiple calendar platforms, allowing users to download and import these events into their own calendar systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, importing these files into applications like Google Calendar can often be cumbersome as it requires several steps: downloading the file, opening the calendar application, navigating to the import settings, and then uploading the file. This process can be time-consuming and not very user-friendly, especially for users on mobile devices or those managing multiple events.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our solution simplifies this process. By uploading your ICS file here, you can instantly generate a direct link to add your event to Google Calendar. This eliminates the need for multiple steps and provides a seamless integration right from your browser.
