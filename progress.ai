We split the install checklist into phase files and moved them under extensions/subscribed-toolbar/instructions. Each phase now ends by asking the user to paste the next URL (AI fetches are blocked). Start point is https://www.fishdan.com/ai_instructions/instructions/ai_install_phase1.md, and all phase links are relative. We deployed the instructions to the Lightsail WordPress host at /opt/bitnami/wordpress/ai_instructions/instructions and set Content-Type for .md to text/plain. We added no-cache headers for /opt/bitnami/wordpress/ai_instructions in both wordpress vhost configs, fixed Apache, and confirmed headers now include Cache-Control/Pragma/Expires with 200 OK. Despite this, the web loader still blocks AI-initiated fetches; next step is to soften prompt language (avoid “load/fetch”), or collapse into a single file / paste-only flow.
