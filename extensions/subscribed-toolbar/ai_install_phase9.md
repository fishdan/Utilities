# Phase 9 - Confirm Source of Truth

## Steps

- Tell the user that you just loaded these instructions and list the URL you loaded them from. Then tell them what phase we are starting (Phase 9).
- User explicitly confirms understanding:
  - Jsonmaker controls structure and content
  - Browser toolbar mirrors Jsonmaker
- **WAIT** for confirmation
- Tell the user we are finishing Phase 9.

---

After Phase 9 is confirmed, load `ai_install_phase10.md` and continue.
