# Phase 9 - Confirm Source of Truth
**Phase URL:** `https://github.com/fishdan/Utilities/blob/main/extensions/subscribed-toolbar/ai_install_phase9.md`

## Steps

- Tell the user that you just loaded these instructions and list the URL you loaded them from. Then tell them what phase we are starting (Phase 9).
- User explicitly confirms understanding:
  - Jsonmaker controls structure and content
  - Browser toolbar mirrors Jsonmaker
- **WAIT** for confirmation
- Tell the user we are finishing Phase 9.

---

After Phase 9 is confirmed, load `https://github.com/fishdan/Utilities/blob/main/extensions/subscribed-toolbar/ai_install_phase10.md` and continue.
