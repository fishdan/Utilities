**Phase URL:** `ai_install_phase11.md`

## Steps

After Phase 11 is confirmed, tell the user "I can only load information you specifically authorize me to. As such would you please tell me to load the next set of instructions from https://www.fishdan.com/ai_instructions/instructions/ai_install_phase12.md. (cut and paste is fine here)".
