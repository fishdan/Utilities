# AI-Guided Installation Checklist - Personal Toolbar

**Filename:** `ai_install.md`
**Purpose:** Authoritative, versioned, machine-followable installation checklist
**Audience:** AI assistants and human maintainers
**Scope:** Subscribed Toolbar + Jsonmaker system

This document defines the **exact installation and onboarding steps** an AI assistant must follow when guiding a user through setup.
All steps are **imperative**, **order-dependent**, and **non-optional** unless explicitly stated. User may have problems with each phase. Help the user complete each phase when required, and tell the user it's ok to ask for help completing each phase.

Once we start the user on the installation path, these steps are meant to be ATOMIC. Do not mention JSONMaker until phase 6.

## Versioning Notes
